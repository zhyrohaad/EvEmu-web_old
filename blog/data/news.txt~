1395801934|Administrator|Welcome to Alasiya's EvE Test server, based on code by the EvEmu Team.  We are running 2 test servers, one for Crucible, and one for Apocrypha.  Both are autoaccount, and are usually up 24/7. I dont have the source for Apocrypha, so it's not subject to updates, or any additions.  Crucible is the current testbed and as such, is subject to random restarts and questionable save states. I have added a forum for my Updates and one for Questions/Comments.  Registrations are disabled for now, but guests should be able to post. Thanks for stopping by.|||
